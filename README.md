# Swensens Clone

This is a Swensen's Clone

## This is intended to be used for an application for CODEDEVA only

This web application is created with T3 Stack which includes

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org) as an authenticator and sesssion provider
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) as a ORM (Object Relational Mapping) [In this case I use PostgreSQL under the hood]
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) (my personal favorite way to write CSS)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) (for building a typesafe API)
